## Bioinformatics talk
 Here you can find the slides I used in my talk about how maths and bioinformatics are inherently connected. I explain what maths topics are usually used in bioinformatics. You can also find the rest of the talk, including the biology and computer science parts, which were made by Carlos Herraiz and Carmen (C.S. and biology respectively).

 Feel free to ask me about anything there. English versions will be submitted soon with some recommende bibliography.
